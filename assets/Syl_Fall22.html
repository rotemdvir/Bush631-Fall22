<p>The best place to ask questions is in the classroom. If your question is not related to class material or relevant to other students, we can discuss it after class. Outside the classroom, there are two ways to get in touch:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Office Hours: I encourage you to visit my office hours to discuss any difficulties with the course. I recommend watching <a href="https://vimeo.com/270014784">this Video (link)</a> - it is both fun and offers some pointers on office hours. I am available to meet outside of office hours, but you must contact me in advance so we can schedule a time that works for both of us.<br>
</li>
<li>Email: you can <strong>always</strong> email me with any concern you have (class-related or not). You can expect me to reply to emails within 24 hours during the work week. I will not reply to emails on the weekend, except for urgent matters. If the situation requires it, we can set-up a Zoom meeting and discuss the matter instead of via email. As with all business related correspondence, please include an appropriate salutation, identify yourself, and write in complete sentences.</li>

<p>This is a graduate course in quantitative social science research methods. We will learn about various methods to design a research and use quantitative data to tackle a variety of questions in politics as a whole, and international affairs in particular. For example, how to predict election outcomes? What factors drive the onset of wars? What is the likelihood of a successful sanctions regime? Which type of leaders are more prone to concede in disputes? and how public opinion shape the decision to enter negotiations? You will obtain knowledge that is useful beyond academia. Many private companies and non-profits have invested heavily in data science techniques to learn about their users, platforms, markets, and programs. Data scientists at these institutions are essentially applied social scientists and employ many of the same techniques you will learn in this course.</p>
<p>This course will cover the tools and techniques of quality research design and the introductory statistical skills that are designed to give you an understanding of the appropriate uses (and mis-uses) of quantitative research tools. The goal is to provide you with the capability to understand, explain, and perform social science research, with a special focus on data analysis and causal reasoning. You will be able to read and understand how quantitative research methods are used in the social sciences. In addition, you will have a foot in the door of the data science world - this course will help you become proficient in the use of statistical software to manage and analyze data. The skills of collecting and analyzing data in a sophisticated manner has become crucial for the modern job market across industries. Finally, you will obtain data literacy that will help you become a critical consumer of evidence and information.</p>

<section id="attendance-and-participation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="attendance-and-participation">Attendance and Participation</h3>
<p>Class attendance will count for <em>five (5) percent</em> of your final grade. I expect you to actively participate in class discussions, ask questions, listen to your fellow students, and be attentive. Learning research methods is much easier when done in concert with others.<br>
You are allowed to have one <strong>free unexcused absence</strong> from class. After one unexcused absence, I will deduct one point from the 5 possible attendance points for each unexcused absence. Excused absences are not deducted from your grade. I will decide what counts as excused on a case-by-case basis, but in general absences will only be excused for good reasons. You must contact me <strong>before</strong> missing class. If you have more than six (6) unexcused absences, you will receive an F in the course.<br>
If you do have any problems that do not allow you to perform well in class, please email me ASAP. I am willing to work with you, but this is only possible if you come talk to me early enough.</p>

As commonly defined, plagiarism consists of passing off as one’s own the ideas, words, writings, etc., which belong to another. In accordance with the definition, you are committing plagiarism if you copy the work of another person and turn it in as your own, even if you should have the permission of the person. Plagiarism is one of the worst academic sins, for the plagiarist destroys the trust among colleagues without which research cannot be safely communicated. If you have any questions regarding plagiarism or any other form of academic misconduct, please consult the Aggie Honor System Office website <a href="http://www.tamu.edu/aggiehonor">http://www.tamu.edu/aggiehonor</a> or the latest version of the Texas A&amp;M University Student Rules, under the section “Scholastic Dishonesty.” <a href="http://rules.tamu.edu">http://rules.tamu.edu</a>.

<section id="title-ix-statement-on-limits-to-confidentiality" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="title-ix-statement-on-limits-to-confidentiality">Title IX Statement on Limits to Confidentiality</h3>
<p>Texas A&amp;M University is committed to fostering a learning environment that is safe and productive for all. University policies and federal and state laws provide guidance for achieving such an environment. Although class materials are generally considered confidential pursuant to student record policies and laws, University employees - including instructors - cannot maintain confidentiality when it conflicts with their responsibility to report certain issues that jeopardize the health and safety of our community. As the instructor, I must report (per Texas A&amp;M System Regulation 08.01.01) the following information to other University offices if you share it with me, even if you do not want the disclosed information to be shared: Allegations of sexual assault, sexual discrimination, or sexual harassment when they involve TAMU students, faculty, or staff, or third parties visiting campus.<br>
These reports may trigger contact from a campus official who will want to talk with you about the incident that you have shared. In many cases, it will be your decision whether or not you wish to speak with that individual. If you would like to talk about these events in a more confidential setting, you are encouraged to make an appointment with the Student Counseling Service <a href="https://scs.tamu.edu/">https://scs.tamu.edu/</a>. Students and faculty can report non-emergency behavior that causes them to be concerned at <a href="http://tellsomebody.tamu.edu">http://tellsomebody.tamu.edu</a>.</p>

<p>To help protect Aggieland and stop the spread of COVID-19, Texas A&amp;M University urges students to be vaccinated and to wear masks in classrooms and all other academic facilities on campus, including labs. Doing so exemplifies the Aggie Core Values of respect, leadership, integrity, and selfless service by putting community concerns above individual preferences. COVID-19 vaccines and masking — regardless of vaccination status — have been shown to be safe and effective at reducing spread to others, infection, hospitalization, and death.</p>

<section id="less-official-pandemic-stuff" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="less-official-pandemic-stuff">Less official pandemic stuff</h3>
<p>Texas A&amp;M University does not have a mask or vaccination mandate, but as the previous statement mentions, it is highly recommended.<br>
I will be wearing a mask in class (and I am fully vaccinated). Following <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html">CDC guidlines</a>, I strongly recommend/urge/encourage you to wear a mask in class regardless of your vaccination status. I will place a box of disposable masks by the door if you would like one.</p>
<p>Again, Texas A&amp;M University <strong>does not require either vaccines or masks</strong>, and if you are not vaccinated or do not wear a mask, there are no penalties.</p>
